# Weatherly App 🌤️

Welcome to **Weatherly App**, a modern web application built to provide accurate and real-time weather updates with a seamless user experience.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project exemplifies my expertise in building performant, scalable, and visually appealing web applications. By leveraging cutting-edge tools and technologies, I've created an application that is not only fast but also easy to maintain and extend. 

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Lightning-fast development and build tooling for modern web projects.
- **State Management**: Context API
- **Styling**:  CSS and [MUi](https://mui.com/) - An open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
- **ESLint Configuration**: Configured with rules for clean and maintainable code.
  - Plugins used:
    - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) - Babel-based React plugin for fast refresh.
    - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) - SWC-based React plugin for fast refresh.
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript 

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time weather updates.
- User-friendly interface designed for intuitive navigation.
- High performance with minimal load times.
- API integrations, responsiveness

## 👨‍💻 What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding and skills in:
- Building React applications with modern tools like Vite.
- Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- Optimizing web applications for performance and user experience.
